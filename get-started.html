            Using <a href="/">Kraftwagen</a> in your own projects is fairly 
            easy, especially if you are a seasoned Drupal developer already. 
            This page is aimed at developers that are already familiar with 
            Drupal.
          </p>
          <section id="installation">
            <div class="page-header">
              <h1>Installation</h1>
            </div>
            <p>
              To install Kraftwagen, you will need to install Drush and install
              Kraftwagen at a location that Drush can reach it. Drush can be
              installed in your home directory or globally. Take a look at the
              Drush documentation for more information about this. After you
              installed Drush you can install Kraftwagen as any other extension
              in the global directory (<code>/usr/share/drush/commands</code>) 
              or in your home directory (<code>~/.drush</code>).
            </p>

            <h2>Per project</h2>
            <p>
              If you prefer to keep a Drush and Kraftwagen installation per 
              project, Kraftwagen provides a little tool for that. Change to the
              directory your project in located in (not the <code>src</code> 
              dir, but the project root directory). Take a look at our
              <a href="https://github.com/kraftwagen/tools">Kraftwagen Tools
              repository</a>.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section id="new-project">
            <div class="page-header">
              <h1>Create a new project</h1>
            </div>

            <p>
              Creating a new project is done using the 
              <code>drush kw-new-project</code> command. This command uses a so
              called <em>skeleton</em> to kickstart a project. A skeleton for
              Kraftwagen is a Git repository that contains the starting point 
              for a project. Kraftwagen provides an 
              <a href="https://github.com/kraftwagen/skeleton">example
              skeleton</a> which you can fork to create your own.
            </p>

            <p>
              Start by creating a directory for your project and changing to 
              this directory. Then run <code>drush kw-new-project</code> in this
              directory. This command will ask for the human readable name of 
              the project and the machine name of the project. Then it will ask
              for the location of the skeleton repository and which branch to 
              us from the repository. When you supplied all the information, it
              will clone the skeleton repository and create a <code>src</code>
              directory in your current directory that contains the source of
              the project that is generated from the skeleton.
            </p>

            <p>
              Now the source of the project is created. We advise you to use 
              your favorite version control system to create the initial commit
              of your project. 
            </p>

            <p>
              You're now at the same state as 
              <a href="#setup-project-sub">after checking out an existing 
              project</a>.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section id="setup-project">
            <div class="page-header">
              <h1>Setting up existing projects</h1>
            </div>

            <p>
              To get started on an existing project, you'll need to setup the
              project on your computer. First create a directory for the project
              and change to that directory. Then checkout the source code from
              the version control system it is saved in. Make sure the checkout
              is in the <code>src</code> directory.
            </p>

            <p id="setup-project-sub">
              Now run <code>drush kw-setup</code>. This will create a 
              <code>cnf</code> directory with settings files, an 
              <code>environment</code> file and a <code>files</code> directory.
              You should change the <code>settings.local.php</code> file to 
              match your settings. You should choose the correct database
              credentials in this file. Furthermore, if you want to use the
              development settings, you should changes the contents to the
              <code>enviroment</code> file to the 'development' (omit the 
              quotes).
            </p>

            <p>
              You're now ready to create the first <a href="#build">build</a> of
              the project.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section id="build">
            <div class="page-header">
              <h1>Creating a build</h1>
            </div>

            <p>
              The source of the project is not working Drupal installation. It
              doesn't even contain Drupal itself. A working Drupal installation
              that is generated from the source is called a 'build'. 
            </p>
            <p>
              By default the build is created in a directory <code>build</code>.
              If you prefer to keep a directory of all builds and prefer
              <code>build</code> to be a symlink to the current build, you only
              have to create a directory <code>builds</code>. Kraftwagen will
              automatically create the build there if it exists and create a
              symlink for you.
            </p>
            <p>
              A build is created by running <code>drush kw-build</code>. 
            </p>
