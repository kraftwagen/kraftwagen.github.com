            Using <a href="/">Kraftwagen</a> in your own projects is fairly
            easy, especially if you are a seasoned Drupal developer already.
            This page is aimed at developers that are already familiar with
            Drupal.
          </p>
          <section id="installation">
            <div class="page-header">
              <h1>Installation</h1>
            </div>
            <p>
              Kraftwagen builds heavily on
              <a href="http://drupal.org/project/drush">Drush</a>. All command
              line interactions with Kraftwagen are done using Drush.
            </p>
            <p>
              To install Kraftwagen, you will need to install Drush and install
              Kraftwagen at a location where Drush can reach it. Drush can be
              installed globally or in your home directory. Take a look at the
              Drush documentation for more information about this. After you
              installed Drush you can install Kraftwagen as any other extension
              in the global directory (<code>/usr/share/drush/commands</code>)
              or in your home directory (<code>~/.drush</code>). Make sure to
              clear your drush cache with <code>drush cc drush</code> after
              this.
            </p>

            <h2>Per project</h2>
            <p>
              If you prefer to keep a Drush and Kraftwagen installation per
              project, Kraftwagen provides a little tool for that. Change to the
              directory your project in located in (not the <code>src</code>
              dir, but the project root directory). Take a look at our
              <a href="https://github.com/kraftwagen/tools">Kraftwagen Tools
              repository</a>.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section id="new-project">
            <div class="page-header">
              <h1>Create a new project</h1>
            </div>

            <p>
              Creating a new project is done using the
              <code>drush kw-new-project</code> command. This command uses a so
              called <em>skeleton</em> to kickstart a project. A skeleton for
              Kraftwagen is a Git repository that contains the starting point
              for a project. Kraftwagen provides an
              <a href="https://github.com/kraftwagen/skeleton">example
              skeleton</a> which you can fork to create your own.
            </p>

            <p>
              Start by creating a directory for your project and changing to
              this directory. Then run <code>drush kw-new-project</code> in this
              directory. This command will ask for the human readable name of
              the project and the machine name of the project. Then it will ask
              for the location of the skeleton repository and which branch to
              us from the repository. When you supplied all the information, it
              will clone the skeleton repository and create a <code>src</code>
              directory in your current directory that contains the source of
              the project that is generated from the skeleton.
            </p>

            <p>
              Now the source of the project is created. We advise you to use
              your favorite version control system to create the initial commit
              of your project.
            </p>

            <p>
              The source of a Kraftwagen projects is a Drupal install profile.
              Drupal core and contributed modules are pulled in using Drush make
              and `.make` files. This keeps your repository clean and
              maintainable. A great advantage is, that with such a small
              repository it actually is feasible to walk trough all the code to
              review it.
            </p>

            <p>
              You're now at the same state as
              <a href="#setup-project-sub">after checking out an existing
              project</a>.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section id="setup-project">
            <div class="page-header">
              <h1>Setting up existing projects</h1>
            </div>

            <p>
              To get started on an existing project, you'll need to setup the
              project on your computer. First create a directory for the project
              and change to that directory. Then checkout the source code from
              the version control system it is saved in. Make sure the checkout
              is in the <code>src</code> directory.
            </p>

            <p id="setup-project-sub">
              Now run <code>drush kw-setup</code>. This will create a
              <code>cnf</code> directory with some files and directories in it.
            </p>

            <dl>
              <dt><code>settings.php</code> and <code>settings.local.php</code></dt>
              <dd>
                The settings files are copied from the <code>src/cnf</code>
                directory. These files contain target-specific settings for your
                Drupal installation. When generating a working Drupal
                installation from the <code>src</code> (we call that a
                <em>build</em> in Kraftwagen), these files are symlinked to the
                right place in the installation.
              </dd>
              <dt><code>environment</code></dt>
              <dd>
                This file by default contains <code>production</code>. The
                contents of this file controls which environment-specific
                dependencies are installed and which environment-specific
                manifests are run.
              </dd>
              <dt><code>files</code></dt>
              <dd>
                The <code>files</code> directory is an empty directory. It is
                used to store the files that are uploaded by the user. The
                directory will be symlinked to the correct place when generating
                a build (just like the settings files).
              </dd>
            </dl>
            <p>

            <p>
              You should change the <code>settings.local.php</code> file to be
              able to connect to the database. Furthermore, if you want to use
              the development settings, you should changes the contents to the
              <code>enviroment</code> file to <code>development</code>.
            </p>

            <p>
              You're now ready to create the first <a href="#build">build</a> of
              the project.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section id="build">
            <div class="page-header">
              <h1>Creating a build</h1>
            </div>

            <p>
              The source of the project is not a working Drupal installation. It
              doesn't even contain Drupal itself. A working Drupal installation
              that is generated from the source is called a 'build'.
            </p>
            <p>
              By default the build is created in a directory <code>build</code>.
              If you prefer to keep a directory of all builds and prefer
              <code>build</code> to be a symlink to the current build, you only
              have to create a directory <code>builds</code>. Kraftwagen will
              automatically create the build there if it exists and create a
              symlink for you.
            </p>
            <p>
              A build is created by running <code>drush kw-build</code>.
