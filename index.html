        <h2>Release party</h2>
        <p>
          At the upcoming <a href="http://drupal.nl/evenement/drupal-tech-talk-7#kraftwagen">Drupal Tech 
          Talk</a> (7<sup>th</sup> of February 2013 in Rotterdam), we will
          celebrate the public release of Kraftwagen, and demonstrate its capabilities.
          The event information is in Dutch, but we’re very 
          welcoming to non-Dutch Drupal attendees (in which case the talk will be in English).

        <h2>Drupal + Kraftwagen = Drupal for developers</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        One of <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a>’s core values is 
        “easy to use”.  Yet what that means to
        end-users (who uses FTP to upload Drupal to a web host, and customizes
        it though the admin interface), is different from what that means to
        developers (who customize Drupal extensively, need staged deployments
        and use version control systems to collaborate).
      </p>
      <p>
        Kraftwagen makes Drupal “easy to use” for developers.
      </p>

      <div class="page-header">
        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        Kraftwagen consists of a <a href="http://drupal.org/project/drush">Drush</a>
        extension and set of Drupal modules, all
        <a rel="license" href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl">open source</a>
        and <a href="https://github.com/kraftwagen">hosted on github</a>.
        It reuses existing work where possible, for example:
        <a href="http://drupal.org/project/distributions">install profiles</a>,
        <a href="http://drupal.org/project/drush_make">Drush Make</a>,
        <a href="http://drupal.org/project/features">Features</a>,
        version control systems (git, subversion, mercurial, etc.) and soon
        <a href="https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano">Capistrano</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because Drupal stores a lot a configuration details in the database,
        version control systems cannot be used to track changes. This makes it
        hard for a team of developers to collaborate or to stage changes to a
        separate deployment target before rolling them out in production.
        Kraftwagen primarily solves this issue by using
        <a href="https://github.com/kraftwagen/kw-manifests">manifests</a>
        to sync aspects of Drupal project’s different installations
        to the same state.  These aspects can be: configuration details in the
        database, creation of base-line content, setting up static files or
        any other aspect of a Drupal project that can be controlled from PHP.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kraftwagen extends Drupal with:
        <ul>
          <li>The <b><a href="https://github.com/kraftwagen/kraftwagen">kraftwagen</a></b> Drush extension
            &mdash; provides a set of Drush commands to manage an install
            profile based Drupal development and deployment workflow.</li>
          <li>The <b><a href="https://github.com/kraftwagen/kw-itemnames">kw-itemnames</a></b> Drupal module
            &mdash; allowes human names to be assigned to items that are
            mapped to numeric primary keys.</li>
          <li>The <b><a href="https://github.com/kraftwagen/kw-manifests">kw-manifests</a></b> Drupal module
            &mdash; adds support idempotent migrations (manifests).</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <div class="page-header">
        <h2>Goals</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        The following goals where set when developing Krafwagen:
      <dl>
        <dt>Everything in code</dt>
        <dd>We wanted to make sure all the required information to run an 
          application or website is in source code. If some developer checks
          out the project from a repository, he should be able the get it
          running, without manual steps in Drupal’s admin interface or copying
          database dumps.
        </dd>

        <dt>Don’t reinvent the wheel</dt>
        <dd>A lot of effort has already been done in this area and we wanted to
          build on top of that. That’s why Kraftwagen uses the Features module
          and is build completely on top of Drush. Some of the most used 
          Kraftwagen commands are only thin convience wrappers around existings 
          commands or sequences of commands. This also means that most concepts
          in Kraftwagen should sound familiar to any seasoned Drupal developer.
        </dd>

        <dt>Version control independence</dt>
        <dd>
          We didn’t want a tool that locks us completely with Subversion, Git or
          any other version control mechanism. Of course with serious projects
          you’ll really want some sort of version control, but your toolchain
          should not depend on it. <em>Currently, there is one Git dependend 
          command. The command to start a new project uses Git to download the 
          skeleton. We are looking at a way to elegantly solve this, while 
          keeping the convenience of the current command.</em>
        </dd>

        <dt>Environment awareness</dt>
        <dd>
          Drupal itself doesn’t make any difference between staging, production 
          and development environments. In production you’ll want the 
          <a href="http://drupal.org/project/devel">Devel</a> module disabled,
          while in development environments it should be enabled. When copying
          around database dumps this is almost impossible to do automatically.
        <dt>

        <dt>Transparent in use</dt>
        <dd>
          Developers should naturally understand the workflows that Kraftwagen
          facilitates. Therefore Kraftwagen’s command line commands report
          what they are doing and error messages are constructive.
          <a href="/get-started.html">Getting started</a> with Kraftwagen
          should be a breeze for any seasoned Drupal developer.
        <dt>
